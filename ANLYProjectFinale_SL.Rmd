#   Interpretation of Summary Statistics

#   SalePrice ranges from $12,789 to $755,000, with a median of $160,000 and a mean of $180,796, indicating a right-skewed distribution.

#   Year Built ranges from 1872 to 2010, with a median of 1973, suggesting that the dataset includes houses from a wide range of periods, but the majority were built in the mid-to-late 20th century.

#   Gr Liv Area (Total Living Area) ranges from 334 to 5642 square feet, with a median of 1442 square feet and a mean of 1500 square feet, indicating a slight skew towards larger homes.

```

```{r}
#   The histogram of SalePrice shows a right-skewed distribution with most house prices concentrated between $100,000 and $300,000. There are fewer houses with very high prices, which extend up to around $600,000 and beyond.

  labs(title = "SalePrice vs. Year Built", x = "Year Built", y = "SalePrice")

```

```{r}
#   The scatter plot of SalePrice versus Year Built shows a positive relationship, indicating that newer houses tend to have higher sale prices. The trend line (in red) reinforces this positive correlation.

  labs(title = "SalePrice vs. Gr Liv Area", x = "Gr Liv Area", y = "SalePrice")

```

```{r}
#   The scatter plot of SalePrice versus Gr Liv Area (Total Living Area) shows a strong positive relationship. As the living area increases, the sale price also tends to increase. The trend line (in red) highlights this positive correlation, indicating that larger homes generally have higher sale prices.

ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(`Overall Cond`), y = SalePrice)) +

```

```{r}
#   The boxplot of SalePrice by Overall Cond indicates that houses with better overall conditions generally have higher sale prices. As the overall condition rating increases from 1 to 9, there is a noticeable increase in the median sale price, although there is some variability within each condition category.

```

```{r}
#   The boxplot of SalePrice by House Style indicates that different house styles have varying impacts on sale prices. One-story houses (1Story) and two-story houses (2Story) tend to have higher median sale prices compared to other styles. There is also a considerable spread and a number of outliers in these categories, suggesting a wide range of prices within these house styles.

```{r}
#   The multiple linear regression analysis provides the coefficients for each predictor and their respective p-values. Significant predictors will have p-values less than 0.05 and confidence intervals that do not include zero.


#   SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS:

#   Year Built: The positive coefficient indicates that newer houses tend to have higher sale prices.

#   Bldg Type: All building types except the baseline (single-family homes) have negative coefficients, indicating lower sale prices compared to single-family homes, except for TwnhsE which is not significant.

#   House Style: Some house styles, such as 1.5Unf, 1Story, and SFoyer, have significant positive coefficients, indicating higher sale prices compared to the baseline house style. Other styles, such as 2.5Fin and 2Story, have significant negative coefficients.

#   Gr Liv Area: The positive coefficient indicates that larger living areas are associated with higher sale prices.

#   Overall Cond: The positive coefficient indicates that better overall condition ratings are associated with higher sale prices.

# Multiple linear regression model

```{r}
# Stepwise selection to find the best model
stepwise_model <- stepAIC(initial_model, direction = "both")

# Summary of the stepwise model
summary(stepwise_model)

```

```{r}
#   The final model obtained through stepwise selection includes the variables Year Built, Bldg Type, House Style, Gr Liv Area, and Overall Cond. Here are the key takeaways:

#   Year Built: The positive coefficient (1107) indicates that newer houses tend to have higher sale prices.

#   Bldg Type:
#   2fmCon: The negative coefficient (-11500) indicates lower sale prices compared to single-family homes.
#   Duplex: The negative coefficient (-58460) indicates significantly lower sale prices.
#   Twnhs: The negative coefficient (-19400) indicates significantly lower sale prices.
#   TwnhsE: This variable is not significant.

# House Style:
#   1.5Unf, 1Story, and SFoyer have positive coefficients, indicating higher sale prices compared to the baseline house style.
#   2.5Fin and 2Story have negative coefficients, indicating lower sale prices.
#   2.5Unf and SLvl are not significant.

#   Gr Liv Area: The positive coefficient (116.2) indicates that larger living areas are associated with higher sale prices.

#   Overall Cond: The positive coefficient (9361) indicates that better overall condition ratings are associated with higher sale prices.


#   Model Evaluation:
#   The final model has an Adjusted R-squared value of 0.7304, indicating that approximately 73% of the variance in house prices is explained by the model. The F-statistic is highly significant, suggesting that the model is a good fit.
```

```{r}
#Check for Multicollinearity
# Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
vif(stepwise_model)

```

```{r}
#   The Generalized Variance Inflation Factor (GVIF) values indicate that there is no significant multicollinearity among the predictors, as all GVIF values are below the commonly used threshold of 10, and their respective GVIF^(1/(2*Df)) values are below 2. This suggests that the predictors in the model are not highly correlated with each other, which is a good indication for the stability of the model coefficients.

# Model Evaluation
# Residual plots to check for homoscedasticity and normality of residuals
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(stepwise_model)

```

```{r}
#   Interpretation of Residual Plots

#   Residuals vs Fitted Values: Indicates non-linearity, as residuals are not randomly scattered.

#   Q-Q Plot of Residuals: Shows deviation from normality, especially in the tails.

#   Scale-Location Plot: Suggests heteroscedasticity, as residual variance increases with fitted values.

#   Residuals vs Leverage: Identifies influential data points that may need further investigation.
