## Project Title: House Price Prediction using AmesHousing Dataset

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing multiple linear regression models to predict house prices using the AmesHousing dataset. The primary goal is to analyze various features of houses and determine the key factors influencing house prices in Ames, Iowa.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the AmesHousing dataset. It includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

Objectives
To preprocess and clean the dataset.
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
To build multiple linear regression models to predict house prices.
To evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationships between different features and the target variable.
Model Building: Developing multiple linear regression models and experimenting with different feature selections.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Tools and Libraries
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
